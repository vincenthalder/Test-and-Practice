# Test-and-Practice

This is an R-Project to practice coding in R as well as verion controll via git hub. 
In it, I do some analysis of the Titanic data set. 

## Creating this subheadder as a way to practice git using the command line 

I should keep in mind that I now have two local copies of the Repo in different folders on my machine. Whenever I start working on a copy, I shall pull first. Whenever I stop working on a copy, I shall push. 

Greetings!
